A demonstration of ExtJS/Sencha functional testing using the PhantomJS engine.

The following files constitute the testing framework:

- ExtjsTesterPage.html
- ExtjsTester.js

MonthComboBox.js is a custom ExtJS component and MonthComboBoxTest.js is a functional test for it. This test may be run by issuing the following command in the console (assuming that phantomjs executable is on the execution path):

phantomjs ExtjsTester.js MonthComboBoxTest.js

The following files constitute a simple ExtJS application:

- index.html
- app.js
- app/controller/Main.js
- app/controller/Popup.js
- app/view/Main.js
- app/view/Popup.js

AppTest.js is a test for this application that verifies the application logic. It may be run with the following command:
phantomjs ExtjsTester.js AppTest.js
